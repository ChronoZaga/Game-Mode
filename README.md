-Launches Nvidia Control Panel (for any driver/setting tweaks)

-Launches the Nvidia App

-Launches a custom Game Selector (launches any games listed in the Steam, Games, or Call of Duty Start Menu folders)

-Plays a sound to verify speakers/headphones are working


When the "Desktop Mode" button is pushed it...
